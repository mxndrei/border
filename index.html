    <h3>Why Spotify?</h3>
    <p>Spotify includes music alongside audiobooks and podcasts, provides a free plan, and supports more platforms. Spotify has diverse content besides a music catalog with over 82 million songs. You can also listen to podcasts and audiobooks.</p>

    <h3>Why Apple Music?</h3>
    <p>Apple Music is also well-designed, though it can come across as overwhelming with all the different tabs at the bottom of the screen. It seems like Apple wants to show off all the features at first glance, though this tends to get in the way of accessing your content. Apple Music's interface divides its features into separate sections, rather than integrating them into a single scrollable page like Spotify. The large, colorful artwork plays into Apple's design aesthetics, making Apple Music—like the company's other apps—quite pleasing to the eye.</p>
